This study, using the Design of Experiment (DOE), explored the optimal conditions for sprouting green lentils and white peas at home, considering factors such as location, type of lentil, base material, and watering schedule. It found that Arizonaâ€™s environment led to better germination than California's, possibly due to differences in sunlight and temperature. Watering every 12 hours produced better results than watering every 8 hours. Cotton cloth proved to be a better base for growth overall, although white peas performed slightly better on paper towels. Green lentils had higher germination rates than white peas overall. The findings are summarized in a model and graphs that clearly show how these factors influence germination success.
